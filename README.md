The Deep Learning model works like a black box. Deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning. It is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms. While machine learning uses simpler concepts, deep learning works with artificial neural networks, which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn. 

In this project, Different URL has been taken into consideration which are from various background such as sports, business etc., which has been trained and identifies the domain. Naive Bayes has been used which achieved training accuracy of 95.03% and test  accuracy of 84.59 %.
